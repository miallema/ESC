# ESC
This repository contains the project for classifying websites in collaboration with ESC. It is an optional semester project in Data Science COM-508.

The repository contains a slideshow, which describes the data pipeline, a folder containing the data produced during intermediate steps, a folder containing figures, a folder containing the model and the source folder containing code. The source folder contains a jupyter notebook, which englobes the data pipeline. The helper functions are collected in two different files. The first related to data processing and the second to data modelling.
